a) Install SSH

I installed the SSH server on my computer and started it.

b) SSH with keys

I created an SSH key pair and sent the public part to the server

c) Password manager

I installed KeePassXC, which is free and open source. I made a new database with one strong master password. It can create strong random passwords for me, so I donâ€™t need to remember them all. A password manager is needed because it keeps me safe from reusing the same password everywhere and from someone stealing or guessing weak passwords.

d) Encrypt and decrypt with PGP

I import other key and try to encrypt the message but it doesnot work.
